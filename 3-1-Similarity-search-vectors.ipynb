    "In this lab, you will learn how to manually compute several common distance and similarity metrics used in machine learning and information retrieval. These metrics are fundamental to similarity search, which involves comparing data points—often represented as embedding vectors—to identify those that are most alike. Embedding vectors encode information such that their direction typically reflects the semantic content or topic of the input (e.g., a piece of text), while their magnitude can represent the intensity or importance of the encoded features. In this lab, you will calculate the Euclidean distance (L2 norm), dot product, and cosine similarity, gaining a deeper understanding of how these metrics quantify similarity and power search algorithms behind the scenes.\n"
