    "    - Must support tool calling for full functionality.\n",

    "2.  **`tools`**\n",

    "3. If tool calls exist, they're executed and their results are added to the message history\n",
    "4. The updated messages are sent back to the LLM\n",
    "5. This loop continues until the LLM responds without tool calls\n",

    "## Orchestrating multiple tools with an agent: Mathematical toolkit\n",
    "In real-world applications, a single tool is often insufficient to address the complexity and diversity of user requests. Tasks such as data analysis, performing calculations, or retrieving specific information require specialized capabilities that cannot be fulfilled by a single function. By equipping an agent with multiple tools, each tailored to a distinct purpose, you'll create a system that can dynamically select and utilize the appropriate tool based on the user’s query. This approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of the AI, allowing it to handle a broad spectrum of tasks with precision and efficiency. The orchestration of multiple tools ensures that the agent can seamlessly manage complex workflows, making it an essential framework for building robust and versatile AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this concept, let’s create additional tools, i.e, a mathematical toolkit. In addition to the addition tool, you will now create tools for subtraction, multiplication, and division. These tools will be integrated into an agent capable of handling various mathematical queries, showcasing how multiple tools can work together within a single AI system.\n",

Instead of manually wrapping these functions in the Tool class, you'll use the `@tool` decorator to automatically convert them into LangChain tools, using their docstrings as descriptions. These decorated tools can then be added directly to the agent alongside other operations like addition or subtraction, allowing the agent to intelligently select the appropriate operation based on the user's query, making it versatile for handling various math problems.\n"

    "The current functions would benefit from enhanced error handling and input validation. The add_numbers, subtract_numbers, multiply_numbers, and divide_numbers functions should be updated to handle decimal numbers using float conversion, validate inputs more strictly, and provide clear error messages for edge cases. For example, divide_numbers should explicitly check for division by zero, and all functions should gracefully handle non-numeric inputs like \"two\" or \"hundred\". The test cases should be expanded beyond basic operations to include edge cases like divided by zero, empty inputs, and mixed numeric/text inputs (e.g., \"divide one hundred by 5\"). Also consider adding tests for decimal numbers (e.g., \"multiply 3.5 by 2\") and sequential operations (e.g., \"multiply 10 by 2 then add 5\"). This comprehensive testing approach ensures the agent can handle a wide range of real-world mathematical queries.\n"
